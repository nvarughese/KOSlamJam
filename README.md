## Comments
Completed in three days for Knockout Slam Jam, second attempt of using monogame
New elements used:
- Animations
- Character attacks
- Used colours to show characters getting hit and blacking out characters not in play
- Added in characters throughout the game

## Things I could add
- Background
- Opening and closing screen
- Music
- Put it onto the web
- Sprite solidness
      - sprites bounce off each other
      - collision rectangles at base so sprites can walk behind each other
      - draw sprites from top to bottom so they are layered correctly
- Animations could be better, another frame for the attacks
- Change health numbers to bars, can also add bar for attack reset
- More attacks, a special move with a big charge
